The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of how python can be used to set up a relational database, and in addition show understanding of CRUD principals.

A graphical user interface (GUI) has also been developed to allow the end user to interact with the database.

The application is a database for books into which a user can input a title, author, year, and an isbn (international standard book number).  Users can create, read, update, and delete using the buttons on the side of the GUI.
